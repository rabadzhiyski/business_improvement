# Close the gap between technology and business in the retail sector

We believe that solving real business problems is better than focusing on data and technology. Grocery stores invested massively in analytics but they might not get the results they wanted (ROI). The most challenging part is not treating the data but solving the most urgent business problems.

Every facet of grocery retail is becoming more personalized, a trend that is jeopardizing established operating models rooted in a one-to-many mass approach. Advanced analytics has the potential to transform grocery operations, but many retailers struggle to harness these capabilities to improve performance.
