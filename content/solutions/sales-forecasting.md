# Sales Forecasting Dashboard

## Challenge
Bike retailers struggle with unpredictable inventory levels due to extreme sales seasonality—from winter lulls to spring surges and summer peaks. This volatility creates a costly balancing act: overstock during slow periods ties up capital in holding costs, while understocking during peak seasons results in lost sales and disappointed customers.


## Solution

Interactive sales forecasting dashboard specifically designed for the bike retail market. The system analyzes historical sales patterns, seasonal trends, and market indicators to deliver accurate demand predictions with intuitive visualizations that enable retailers to make confident inventory decisions months in advance.

## ROI

**Example Scenario: Mid-sized bike retailer with $5M annual revenue**

**Current Pain Points:**
- Carries $1.5M in inventory at any given time
- Loses ~10% of potential sales ($500K) to stockouts during peak season
- Pays $250K annually in holding costs (warehousing, insurance, financing)
- Spends $100K on emergency orders and markdowns from poor planning

**After Implementing Our System**
- **Reduced inventory waste:** Cut holding costs by 15% → **Save $37K**
- **Fewer stockouts:** Capture 25% more sales during peak periods → **Gain $125K**
- **Smarter ordering:** Eliminate 50% of emergency orders → **Save $50K**
- **Less overstock:** Reduce end-of-season markdowns by 75% → **Save $75K**

**Total Annual Impact: $287K in savings + recovered revenue**

*Results scale proportionally: a $10M retailer could see ~$575K impact, while a $2M retailer might achieve ~$115K.*
