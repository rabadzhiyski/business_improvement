## Challenge
Employee attrition is a major issue for many organizations. It leads to high turnover rates, reduced productivity, and increased costs. In this case, we need to create an employee attrition prevention system that calculates the attrition risks of employees within your organization and recommends prevention strategies.

## Solution

Employee attrition prevention system that calculates the attrition risks of employees within your organization and recommends prevention strategies to retain productive employees. Hosted on a secured cloud-based environment or deployed within your internal organization.

### ROI

An organization that loses 200 productive employees per year has a hidden cost of \$10M/year in lost productivity. And, here's the kicker\... most organizations do not realize it because **productivity is a hidden cost**!

### Benefits

-   **Cost savings:** Employee turnover can be costly for businesses, in terms of recruiting and training new employees. A web app that can predict employee turnover can help a business to take proactive measures to reduce turnover, resulting in significant cost savings.
-   **Improved retention:** By identifying employees who are at risk of leaving the company, the web app can help managers to take steps to improve employee engagement and retention, such as addressing issues with compensation, benefits, or work-life balance.
-   **Better planning:** By forecasting employee turnover, a business can plan for future workforce needs and identify potential skill gaps. This can help a business to make better decisions about hiring, training, and workforce development.
-   **Identifying factors that influence turnover:** A data science web app can help a company to identify factors that influence employee turnovers such as job satisfaction, work environment, or management style. This can help a business to make changes that will improve employee retention and satisfaction.
-   **Improved decision-making:** By providing real-time insights and forecasts, the web app can help managers and executives to make more informed and data-driven decisions related to employee retention.
-   **Anomaly detection:** The ability to detect anomalies in the data, such as an unusual amount of employee turnover in a specific department or team, can help managers identify and address underlying issues more quickly.
