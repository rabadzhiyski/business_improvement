# AI-Powered Price Prediction Dashboard

## Challenge
Retail companies struggle to set optimal prices for products across different markets, categories, and regions, especially when expanding to new territories or launching products in untested segments. Without data-driven pricing strategies, retailers either leave money on the table with conservative pricing or lose sales with overpriced products, while lacking visibility into how product attributes and market dynamics should influence pricing decisions.

## Solution
Interactive price prediction dashboard powered by machine learning algorithms that analyze product portfolios, regional market data, and category performance to recommend optimal pricing strategies. The system enables retailers to predict prices for new products, unexplored markets, or category expansions by leveraging patterns from existing successful products across their entire portfolio.

## ROI
**Example Scenario: Fashion retailer with 5,000 SKUs across 10 countries generating $50M annual revenue**

**Current Pain Points:**
- Loses $2M annually from suboptimal pricing in new market entries
- Misses $1.5M in revenue from underpriced high-demand categories  
- Wastes $800K on inventory that's overpriced for specific regions
- Spends $300K on external pricing consultants and market research
- Takes 3-6 months to establish pricing for new product launches

**After Implementing AI Price Prediction:**
- **Market expansion optimization:** 15% better pricing accuracy in new regions → **Gain $1.2M revenue**
- **Category pricing refinement:** Identify 20% underpriced products → **Capture $900K additional margin**

- **Eliminate consulting costs:** Replace external pricing research → **Save $250K annually**
- **Faster time-to-market:** Reduce pricing decision time by 80% → **Launch products 2-4 months earlier**

**Total Annual Impact: $2.95M in increased revenue and cost savings (35% improvement in pricing efficiency)**
