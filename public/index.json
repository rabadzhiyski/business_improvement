It\u0026rsquo;s a combination of statistics, mathematics, computer science, and domain knowledge that enables organizations to make data-driven decisions.\nThe primary function of a data scientist is to develop algorithms that can learn from large amounts of data in order to make accurate predictions or forecasts about future events. Data science is closely related to statistical analysis and business intelligence; however, businesses generally don\u0026rsquo;t turn directly to data scientists for help with these tasks\u0026mdash;instead turning more readily toward statisticians or business analysts who have been trained specifically in statistical techniques such as regression analysis or decision trees.\nTuring award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a fourth paradigm of science (empirical, theoretical, computational and now data-driven) and asserted that \u0026ldquo;everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology\u0026rdquo; and the data deluge.\nOrigin and Challenges The origins of data science can be traced back to the 1960s, when organizations first started to collect and store large amounts of data. However, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t until the 1990s and 2000s, with the advent of powerful computers and new data storage technologies, that the field began to take shape. Today, data science is a crucial tool for businesses of all sizes, as it allows them to unlock the full potential of their data and gain a competitive edge.\nOne of the biggest challenges of data science is dealing with the vast amount of data that is generated and collected every day. This data can come in many different forms, such as text, images, and videos, and it can be difficult to make sense of it all. Additionally, data science projects often require a high level of technical expertise, which can be difficult for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) to acquire.\nUse Cases Despite these challenges, data science is a valuable tool for SMBs, as it can help them to identify cost savings, optimize performance, and increase revenue. Some of the most common use cases for data science in retail businesses include:\nInventory management: By analyzing data on sales patterns, inventory levels, and product demand, data science can help retailers to optimize their inventory and reduce costs associated with overstocking or stockouts.\nCustomer segmentation: Data science can be used to segment customers based on their demographics, purchasing history, and other characteristics, which can help retailers to target their marketing efforts more effectively.\nDemand forecasting: By analyzing data on historical sales patterns, data science can help retailers to predict future demand for their products, which can help them to optimize their inventory and pricing.\nConclusion Data science has a long history rooted in mathematical concepts, but it\u0026rsquo;s only recently that the field has started to get more attention. With so many people now connected online and generating so much data, there is a huge need for people who can make sense of all of this information. The demand for data scientists will continue to grow as technology continues its rapid development and more industries adopt these approaches into their workflows.\n","permalink":"https://data-science-ai.com/blog/what_is_data_science/","publishdate":"2023-01-25T08:45:27+06:00","summary":"\u0026ldquo;Data science\u0026rdquo; is a term that has been making waves in the business world in recent years, but what exactly is it?\nData science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data.

The company has two main types of customers \u0026mdash; Free and Paid users. Any user can upgrade or downgrade the service at any time. The company stores a decent amount of data that can be used to design a machine learning model to predict what customers would churn so that we can offer them incentives and make them stay as long as possible.\nThe project uses PySpark libraries and it was developed with Jupyter notebooks on a local PC. A Spark cluster was also used in IBM Watson Studio . There are three data sets available with customer data \u0026mdash; mini, medium, and a 12GB data set, provided by Udacity . The mini version was used locally, and the medium-sized data was used in the cluster. The project consists of:\nJupyter Notebook \u0026mdash; where all code is available (working and final version)\nBlog post \u0026mdash; this post\nGithub repository \u0026mdash; where all code can be found\nThe customer churn is addressed through data transformation, feature engineering, and machine learning classification. The best model was chosen based on the AUC-ROC metric. Logistic regression and Random Forest classifier were tested. In the end, the Logistic regression model performed 23% better than the Random Forest classifier.\nProblem statement Customer churn is a very challenging area and it gives many opportunities for analyses. I used PySpark to load, transform data and build a machine-learning algorithm to predict users\u0026rsquo; churn. It was important to find a way to get a realistic probability for users who are prompt to churn based on some features like gender, location, workday, songs played, etc.\nWith the help of several PySpark libraries, I explored the data, engineered the most appropriate features, designed a machine learning pipeline, and chose the most appropriate model for predicting churn. It is a classification task that required Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, or another classification model.\nMetrics To define if I worked correctly and if we can count on the ML model I needed some metrics. For this project, I used the area under AUC-ROC as a performance metric.\nEven if accuracy is a very popular metric, it\u0026rsquo;s not the best choice for binary classification problems which often produce unbalanced data. Like fraud or spam filters, the customer churn data has classes that are distributed unequally.\nFor example, when we run our logistic model it had remarkable accuracy of 99% but AUC-ROC= 65%.\nROC (receiver operating curve) is the visual representation of the performance of the binary classifier. False Positive Rate vs True Positive Rate is plotted to get a visual understanding of the classifier\u0026rsquo;s performance. I chose Logistic regression over Random Forest as it was 23% more performant (0.65 vs 0.5).\nData Exploration We have three data sets \u0026mdash; mini, medium, and big (12GB) data set. For the sake of the exercise, we first started with a mini version of the data. The medium one was used with IBM Watson Studio \u0026mdash; a free cluster with Spark.\nAfter data is loaded we can have a look at the schema.\ndf.printSchema()root |-- artist: string (nullable = true) |-- auth: string (nullable = true) |-- firstName: string (nullable = true) |-- gender: string (nullable = true) |-- itemInSession: long (nullable = true) |-- lastName: string (nullable = true) |-- length: double (nullable = true) |-- level: string (nullable = true) |-- location: string (nullable = true) |-- method: string (nullable = true) |-- page: string (nullable = true) |-- registration: long (nullable = true) |-- sessionId: long (nullable = true) |-- song: string (nullable = true) |-- status: long (nullable = true) |-- ts: long (nullable = true) |-- userAgent: string (nullable = true) |-- userId: string (nullable = true) One useful step before jumping to any exploration is to make sure that the \u0026ldquo;ts\u0026rdquo; column is converted to a human-readable date format. We used some user-defined functions to do that.\n# Check the newly created columns df.select('hour', 'day', 'workday_', 'month').show(5)+----+---+--------+-----+ |hour|day|workday_|month| +----+---+--------+-----+ | 0| 1| Monday| 10| | 1| 1| Monday| 10| | 1| 1| Monday| 10| | 3| 1| Monday| 10| | 4| 1| Monday| 10| +----+---+--------+-----+ only showing top 5 rows Now we\u0026rsquo;re good to go.\nIt would be interesting and useful to dig into the data a little bit.\nHow many songs do users listen to on average between visiting the home page?\nfunction = udf(lambda ishome : int(ishome == 'Home'), IntegerType()) user_window = Window \\ .partitionBy('userID') \\ .orderBy(desc('ts')) \\ .rangeBetween(Window.unboundedPreceding, 0) cusum = df.filter((df.page == 'NextSong') | (df.page == 'Home')) \\ .select('userID', 'page', 'ts') \\ .withColumn('homevisit', function(col('page'))) \\ .withColumn('period', Fsum('homevisit').over(user_window)) cusum.filter((cusum.page == 'NextSong')) \\ .groupBy('userID', 'period') \\ .agg({'period':'count'}) \\ .agg({'count(period)':'avg'}).show() +------------------+ |avg(count(period))| +------------------+ | 23.66741388737015| +------------------+ What are the top 5 played artists?\n# top 5 played artist df.filter(df.page == 'NextSong') \\ .select('Artist') \\ .groupBy('Artist') \\ .agg({'Artist':'count'}) \\ .withColumnRenamed('count(Artist)', 'Artistcount') \\ .sort(desc('Artistcount')) \\ .show(5) +--------------------+-----------+ | Artist|Artistcount| +--------------------+-----------+ | Kings Of Leon| 3497| | Coldplay| 3439| |Florence + The Ma...| 2314| | Muse| 2194| | Dwight Yoakam| 2187| +--------------------+-----------+ only showing top 5 rows We can use previously created date columns to see some patterns in customer behaviors.

Plotly graphing options were used during the project. Let\u0026rsquo;s see some interesting plots that will help us determine the best features for our machine learning model.\nWe first check the location distribution. The biggest number of users are LA residents.\nIt would be more convenient to group the cities into states by creating a new column that takes the last two characters in the row. After that manipulation, we can plot the state distribution. CA, PA, TX, NH, and FL are the top five states.\nWhat are the most active workdays?\nWhat about churn during the week?\nFriday is the churn day.\nWhat are the most active hours for users?\nUsers are most active in the late afternoon and during the evenings.\nWhat are the most active hours for churn then?\nThere is something at 10 am, even if it\u0026rsquo;s not the most active time for users, a lot of churns happen then.\nWhat are the most active days of the month?\nThe second half of the month tends to be a bit busier, but there is not a clear pattern.\nWhat are the most active days during the month?\nThe beginning and the second half of the month are for churn!\nData Preprocessing Based on the exploratory analyses we could pick state, workday, day, and gender as our candidate features for modeling. We can also add SongsPlayed to that as it gives an interesting indication \u0026mdash; users who listen to more songs are less prompt to churn.\n# Get feauture candidates for modeling df.select('userId', 'churn', 'gender', 'workday', 'day', 'state') \\ .where(df.churn != 0).sort('userId').show(20)+------+-----+------+-------+---+-----+ |userId|churn|gender|workday|day|state| +------+-----+------+-------+---+-----+ | 10| 1| M| 2| 9| MS| |100001| 1| F| 2| 2| FL| |100003| 1| F| 4| 8| FL| |100004| 1| F| 7| 14| NY| |100005| 1| M| 6| 6| LA| |100010| 1| F| 4| 11| CT| |100011| 1| M| 3| 21| OR| |100012| 1| M| 2| 6| WI| |100013| 1| F| 2| 2| OH| |100014| 1| M| 7| 21| PA| |100016| 1| M| 2| 23| IL| |100017| 1| M| 2| 13| AL| |100018| 1| M| 1| 8| TX| |100023| 1| M| 6| 6| SC| |100024| 1| M| 2| 13| PA| |100025| 1| F| 2| 6| PA| |100028| 1| F| 7| 21| WA| |100030| 1| F| 3| 3| CA| |100032| 1| M| 4| 4| TX| |100036| 1| M| 5| 5| OK| +------+-----+------+-------+---+-----+ only showing top 20 rows Spark cannot work with strings when building a model.

I used StringIndexer and OneHotEncoder to create a vector column of the available state.\n# Create a StringIndexer state_indexer = StringIndexer(inputCol =”state”, outputCol =”state_index”)# Create a OneHotEncoder state_encoder = OneHotEncoder(inputCol=”state_index”, outputCol=”state_fact”) The difference between Scikit-learn and Spark machine learning approaches is the features. In Spark, we should encode all features into one vectored column. I used VectorAssembler to do that.\n# Make a VectorAssembler vec_assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=[“gender”, “state_fact”, “workday”, “day”, “SongsPlayed”], \\ outputCol=”features”) Implementation Once all data is good for modeling, the next step is to create a machine learning pipeline. The pipeline is a class in the pyspark.ml module that combines all the Estimators and Transformers that I already created. This lets me reuse the same modeling process over and over again by wrapping it up in one simple object.\n# Make the pipeline churn_pipe = Pipeline(stages=[state_indexer, state_encoder, vec_assembler]) After data is cleaned and gotten ready for modeling, one of the most vital steps is to split the data into a test set and a train set.\nIn Spark, it\u0026rsquo;s important to make sure you split the data after all the transformations. This is because operations like StringIndexer don\u0026rsquo;t always produce the same index even when given the same list of strings.\n# Fit and transform the data piped_data = churn_pipe.fit(model).transform(model)# Split the data into training and test sets training, test = piped_data.randomSplit([.6, .4]) For this project, I used Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier to define churn. The very first pick for a classification model should always be the logistic regression. It\u0026rsquo;s a basic model but gives a good ground for machine learning predictions.\nRefinement I tuned my model using k-fold cross-validation. This is a method of estimating the model\u0026rsquo;s performance on unseen data. It works by splitting the training data into a few different partitions \u0026mdash; I used Spark\u0026rsquo;s default values.\nOnce the data is split up, one of the partitions is set aside, and the model is fit to the others. Then the error is measured against the held-out partition. This is repeated for each of the partitions so that every block of data is held out and used as a test set exactly once. Then the error on each of the partitions is averaged. This is called the cross-validation error of the model and is a good estimate of the actual error on the held-out data.\nYou need to create a grid of values to search over when looking for the optimal hyperparameters. With the help of cross-validation, I chose the hyperparameters by creating a grid of the possible pairs of values for the two hyperparameters, elasticNetParam and regParam, and using the cross-validation error to compare all the different models.\nThe submodule pyspark.ml.tuning includes a class called ParamGridBuilder that does just that.You\u0026rsquo;ll need to use the .addGrid() and .build() methods to create a grid that you can use for cross-validation. The .addGrid() method takes a model parameter and a list of values that you want to try. The .build() method takes no arguments, it just returns the grid that I used later.\n# Create the parameter grid grid = tune.ParamGridBuilder() grid_rf = tune.ParamGridBuilder()# Logistic Regression grid grid = grid.addGrid(lr.regParam, np.arange(0, .1, .01)) grid = grid.addGrid(lr.elasticNetParam, [0, 1])# Random Forest grid grid_rf = grid_rf.addGrid(rf.numTrees,[3, 10, 30]) The sub-module pyspark.ml.tuning also has a class called CrossValidator for performing cross-validation.\n# Create the CrossValidator cv = tune.CrossValidator(estimator=lr, estimatorParamMaps=grid, evaluator=evaluator_ROC ) The script I built combines all the above chunks into one action that istailored to suit a Logistic Regression and a Random Forest Classifier. Once run, the next step is to fit the model and select the best one. This task takes a lot of time and it depends on the resources in use.\n# Fit cross validation models - this steps takes a lot of time models = cv.fit(training)# Extract the best model best_lr = models.bestModel Model Evaluation and Validation To make sure I properly assess the performance of the models I used a common metric for binary classification algorithms called the AUC (area under the curve \u0026mdash; numerical representation of the performance of binary classifier). In this case, the curve is the ROC (receiver operating curve \u0026mdash; the visual representation of the performance of the binary classifier. False Positive Rate vs True Positive Rate is plotted to get the visual understanding of the classifier\u0026rsquo;s performance). Both models were measured against AUC-ROC.\nJustification Accuracy is the most common measure but definitely ignores many factors like false positives and false negatives that are brought into the system by a model.\nTo demonstrate why it is important to use the proper metric I will share the results from my models (random forest performed 23% less compared to the logistic regression).\nLogistic regression results:\nAccuracy = 99%\nArea under ROC = 65%\nRandom Forests results:\nAccuracy = 99%\nArea under ROC = 55%\nIf I consider only accuracy I would be too confident of my model. Since I deal with unbalanced data a better estimation of the model\u0026rsquo;s performance is the Area under ROC, which turns to be 65%.\nReflection Predicting churn is not an easy task but with the help of Spark and python, it could get really fun. Of course, none of the techniques would matter if the model that I created is useless for real business.\nIn my scenario, I used the gender, day, workday, state, and songs played per user to predict churn. Based on exploratory data analyses I decided that those features are good for prediction. I found some patterns, especially for churned users.\nThen, I transformed the whole data set to be readable by Spark\u0026rsquo;s machine learning libraries.I used Logistic Regression and Random Forests to design a machine learning algorithm.\nIn the end, I found that Accuracy is a misleading metric for my project, so I counted on the area under ROC output to measure performance.\nImprovement As the famous British statistician George Box stated \u0026ldquo;All models are wrong but some are useful\u0026rdquo;.\nThe AUC-ROC of my models are not so good and I would look further into the data to choose a different set of features. Maybe a number of thumbs-up could be a reasonable candidate. There are plenty of opportunities to test various feature combinations to improve the model\u0026rsquo;s performance.\nI think that we should always link the models to the business context and make some assumptions about their use. For me, predicting churn was a challenging task and I would not say that my model is the best possible solution. However, it gave me a fresh inside and reasonable confidence that with the right features, I can identify some clients who are prompt to churn.\nReferences https://towardsdatascience.com/dealing-with-imbalanced-dataset-642a5f6ee297 https://medium.com/@sarath13/area-under-the-roc-curve-explained-d056854d3815 https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.5.2/ https://www.kaggle.com/lpdataninja/machine-learning-with-apache-spark/notebook https://www.udacity.com/course/learn-spark-at-udacity\u0026amp;ndash;ud2002 ","permalink":"https://data-science-ai.com/blog/customer-churn-spark/","publishdate":"2021-06-04T08:45:27+06:00","summary":"Technical report with code chunks I used PySpark to predict customer churn of a company that provides online music services.
